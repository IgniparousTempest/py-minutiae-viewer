# Open Fingerprint Minutiae Viewer
Open Fingerprint Minutiae Viewer is a cross-platform, open-source, multi-format minutiae viewer, editor, and extractor. It is an alternative to the [FpMV](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/fingerprint-minutiae-viewer-fpmv) by the NBIST.

## How to Install

## Modes

There are two modes:

1. Extraction mode: This loads an image and uses MINDTCT to extract and display minutiae.
2. Editor mode: This allows you to manually edit the detected minutiae or minutiae loaded from an external file.
